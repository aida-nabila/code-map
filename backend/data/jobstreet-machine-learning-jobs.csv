Great Team
Hi, my name is Timothy and I’m a team manager. I started my career at DHL IT Services back in 2007, when I took a role as Capacity Planning Engineer in the Network team. Gaining more hands-on experience with Data Analytics has always fascinated me, so I moved to the Network Monitoring team. From there, I moved fast through the company ladder and soon landed a Principal Network Engineer role. In 2016, I moved to a management role, being Head of Tools and Monitoring. Together with the strong support of a multinational & diverse team, we are working on our common ambition – Data Analytics and Monitoring technology. Looking forward to having you onboard!
